# Bahnar Ontology Map
The "Bahnar Ontology Map" project was devised for Mr. David Harrison to document the Bahnar language and develop innovative conservation techniques.

Since the current understanding and study of the Bahnar language is still limited, we would like to overcome the language barrier and bring everyone closer to the treasure trove of environmental and cultural # knowledge the Bahnar community offers. 

The proposed approach involves developing an interactive ontology map capable of automatically categorizing input terms according to their defining characteristics (such as surroundings or animals) and generating a visual representation that allows for user interaction.
